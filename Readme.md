#In advance of Tuesdays awesome Augmented Reality Workshop, please make sure you have the boilerplate prepared! Please complete the following steps ahead of time. This will give us more time to focus on the fun parts of the workshop! 

###Step 0: Make sure your computer is set up to develop react native applications. This means that with a generic `react-native init <project>` you are able to get something up and running in react native. 

###The goal of these steps is to get a simple "hello world" AR project working before the workshop. 

###The repo is at: https://github.com/simistern/ARWorkshop01

#Steps to prepare for Workshop 

1. Get an API key from ViroReact -> https://viromedia.com/signup
2. Download Viromedia app to your phone, we need this for its TestBed feature which will help us iterate faster!  
3. globally install ngrok with npm or yarn  
4. globally install react-viro-cli with npm or yarn 
5. In your  react-viro init <MyJSWorkshop>
6. Put your API key inside your App.js file
7. Run the app:  `npm start`
8. Run ngrok! using the command  `ngrok http 8081`
9. Ngrok should give you a forwarding address at `https://<stuff>.ngrok.io`
10. Find the testbed on the ViroMedia app and enter that address in. If all goes well, your app should render!
