#### In advance of the Augmented Reality Workshop, please make sure you have the boilerplate prepared! Please complete the following steps ahead of time. This will give us more time to focus on the fun parts of the workshop! 

##### Step 0: Make sure your computer is set up to develop react native applications. This means that with a generic `react-native init <project>` you are able to get something up and running in react native. 

The goal of these steps is to get a simple "hello world" AR project working before the workshop. 

The repo is at: https://github.com/simistern/ARWorkshop01

## Steps to prepare for Workshop 

Step 1: Download Viromedia app to your phone, we need this for its TestBed feature which will help us iterate faster!  
Step 2: globally install ngrok with npm or yarn  
Step 3: globally install react-viro-cli with npm or yarn 
Step 4: In your  react-viro init **[MyJSWorkshop]**
Step 5: Put your API key inside your App.js file
Step 6: Run the app:  npm start
Step 7: Run ngrok! using the command  ngrok http 8081
step 8: Ngrok should give you a forwarding address at https://[myurl].ngrok.io
step 9: Find the testbed on the ViroMedia app and enter that address in. If all goes well, your app should render!
